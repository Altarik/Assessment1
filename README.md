- This website manages Flights.
- Data is stored in a .mdf file, feel free to explore it (to get Aircraft data, used in computations)
- GPS Distance is computed using DBGeography column types 
- Data is managed by Entity Framework (DB first)
- Once a Flight is created, the Consumed Fuel and the distance are computed then displayed directly on the index table.
